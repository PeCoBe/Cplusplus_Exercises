# 📝 C++ Exercise 

Welcome to my C++ Exercise Repository! This repository is dedicated to practicing C++ programming, with the help of CMake and Jenkins.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone it to your local machine and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/c-plus-plus-exercises.git
cd c-plus-plus-exercises
```

## 💻 Prerequisites
Before you can begin practicing C++ with this repository, you'll need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- CMake
- C++ Compiler (such as GCC or Clang)
- Jenkins (for continuous integration)

## 🧩 Building with CMake
To build the C++ exercises in this repository, you'll need to use CMake. CMake is a powerful cross-platform build system that can generate build files for a wide range of platforms and compilers.

To build the exercises, navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## 🚦 Continuous Integration with Jenkins
This repository also includes support for continuous integration with Jenkins. Jenkins is an open-source automation server that can be used to automate various tasks, such as building and testing software.

To set up Jenkins for this repository, simply follow the instructions in the Jenkinsfile located in the root of the repository.

Happy coding! 🎉
